# Ex-Text-Transform

A fun Python project to help you stay "Ex-Free" by transforming any text involving your ex into something silly and distracting. It tracks how many days you have stayed "Ex-Free" and gives you fun messages to keep your mind off things.

## Features

- **Track "Ex-Free" Days**: The app tracks how many days you’ve stayed away from your ex by calculating the number of days since you started your no-contact period.
- **Transform Text to Fun**: Any time you mention your ex or mutual friends, the app transforms your message into something absurd and fun.
- **Persistent Data**: The app saves your information (ex's name, mutual friends, and start date) locally in a `user_data.txt` file so you don’t have to re-enter it every time you run the app.

## How to Use

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Ex-Text-Transform.git
   cd Ex-Text-Transform
